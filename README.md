To host your application via VS Code using the Live Server extension, you can follow these steps:

First, make sure you have installed the Live Server extension in your VS Code editor. If you haven't, you can install it from the VS Code marketplace by searching for "Live Server" and clicking the install button.

Once you have installed the Live Server extension, navigate to your project folder in VS Code and create an index.html file in the root directory. If you already have an index.html file, make sure it's in the root directory.

Now, right-click on the index.html file in the VS Code file explorer and select "Open with Live Server" from the context menu. This will launch the Live Server extension and automatically open your application in your default browser.

That's it! You can now use Live Server to host your application in VS Code and make changes in real-time.
